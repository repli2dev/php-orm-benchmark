# PHP ORM Benchmark [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark)

The benchmark to compare performance of PHP ORM solutions.

Initially this project used Docker to facilitate PHP ORM benchmarks. But after [repeated](https://github.com/sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark/pull/12) [comments](https://github.com/sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark/issues/7) I decided to transfer the benchmarks to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark).

So everyone [can see the results](https://travis-ci.org/sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark) or run them again. Actually I've enabled the daily [cron job on Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/cron-jobs/).

NOTE: Some ORMs rely (depends) on models metadata caching. Thus, to avoid [controversy](https://github.com/sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark/issues/4) there is an ability to create and run test with metadata caching support.

## ORMs to Benchmark

* CakePHP ORM 3.5.10
* Doctrine ORM 2.5.14
* Eloquent 5.5.28
* PHP ActiveRecord 1.2.0
* Phalcon 3.3.1
* Propel ORM 2.0.0-alpha7
* Yii ActiveRecord 2.0.13.1
* DMS 0.8.2

## Benchmarking Environment

* Ubuntu 14.04.5 (Trusty) 64bit (Travis CI)
* PHP 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
* Zend OPcache 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
* MySQL 5.6

## What we test

* Insert a record to the Database
* Get first record with relation
* Get first record with relation and metadata caching
* Insert a record to the Database (10-fold method call)
* Get first record with relation (10-fold method call)
* Get first record with relation and metadata caching (10-fold method call)
* Get a batch of first 20 records with relation
* Get a batch of first 20 records with relation and metadata caching
* Get a batch of first 200 records with relation
* Get a batch of first 200 records with relation and metadata caching

## Results

Get first record with relation (10-fold method call). Build [#43](https://travis-ci.org/sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark/builds/327563062), PHP 7.0.
